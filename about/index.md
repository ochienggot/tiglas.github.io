</> Programming skills

* Fluent in Python and Java
* C/C++ (prior experience)
* Bash scripting
* Android programming (beginner)

What do I do in my free time?

* I like learning new technologies. I am currently picking up Android programming by building applications. I have recently built a popular movies app. These side projects are hosted on Github: <a href="https://github.com/Tiglas"> tiglas </a>. 
* Languages intrigue me a lot - I'm currently learning [survival] Swedish. 
* I am a member of <a href="http://www.v-dala.se/association/samba-sao-miguel/"> Samba São Miguel</a> where I get to practise my
rather awkward dance moves.
* Traveling affords me the opportunity to discover new places and experiences.
